# share-events :guitar:

Free time is a valuable resource. Every day we plan how to spend it and where and with whom to go. The hardest part of planning is finding information and negotiating. There are many details to consider: what events are planned, whether friends are free at that moment, how to invite everyone, and where to gather.
In this poster you can suggest an event from an exhibition to a movie and gather a group to attend it.
